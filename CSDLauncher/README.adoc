== Project set up

To develop your own application with Maps SDK, you need to make sure that the *pre-requisites* are in place and that you have added Maps SDK  as a dependency into your project. Follow the steps below and then you are ready to code!

[[pre-requisites]]
=== Get the pre-requisites in place:

* Android Studio IDE installed (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[Android Studio]).
* Set up the application minimum API level to Android 4.4 "Kit Kat" (API Level 19) or higher.

[[setting-up-a-project]]
=== Set up your project like this:

1.  Open Android Studio IDE
2.  Create a new project or open an existing one


[[projects-access]]
=== Add repositories to all projects to root/build.gradle:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
allprojects {

   repositories {
      google()
      jcenter()
      maven {
         url 'https://maven.tomtom.com:8443/nexus/content/repositories/releases/'
      }
   }   
}
----

=== Configuration for all Maps SDK modules

To include all Maps SDK modules in your app, modify AndroidManifest.xml
and build.gradle files

* Key initialization +
Please use dedicated constructors/methods to directly initialize with the API Key taken from http://developer.tomtom.com. +
This approach is more thoroughly described in the modules' documentation pages.

** Maps
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
val keysMap = mapOf(
    ApiKeyType.MAPS_API_KEY to "maps-key",
    ApiKeyType.TRAFFIC_API_KEY to "traffic-key"
)
MapProperties.Builder()
    .keys(keysMap)
    .build()
----


** Search
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
val searchApi = OnlineSearchApi.create(context, apiKey)
----

** Routing
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
val routingApi = OnlineRoutingApi.create(context, apiKey)
----


** Traffic
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
val trafficApi = OnlineTrafficApi.create(context, apiKey)
----

** Geofencing
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
val geofencingApi = GeofencingApi(context, apiKey)
----

* Modify build.gradle (app/build.gradle)

+
[source,shell,indent=0, subs="attributes"]
----
//library required to display map
api "com.tomtom.online:sdk-maps:{libversion}"

//library required for search
api "com.tomtom.online:sdk-search:{libversion}"

//library required for routing
api "com.tomtom.online:sdk-routing:{libversion}"

//library required for traffic
api "com.tomtom.online:sdk-traffic:{libversion}"

//library required for geofencing
api "com.tomtom.online:sdk-geofencing:{libversion}"
----

* Enable Java 8 Support in build.gradle (app/build.gradle)

+
[source,shell,indent=0]
----
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
----

* Add MultiDex support if required, as described https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex.html[here]
